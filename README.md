 ## Inspiration from top osu! players
 
 - [1E308 (Nameless player)'s score submission video (Timestamp to score submission)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7x7OXpUmss&t=647s&ab_channel=RoriSanbyaku)

## The Purpose of "Offline Playing"
 
 - [Spazza17's Fix Negative Mindset in osu! â€” Start Doing THIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEyVSiY9ohU&ab_channel=Spazza17)
 
 It is proven by the osu! community that players could perform better without focusing on score leaderboards (global, country, and friends rankings) 
 
 While playing "offline" using osu! Escape, players would be able to upload scores with better performance.
 
 ## Features
 
 These features are currently only available on osu! standard but not osu! lazer 
 
 - **Global Toggle Key:** 
 > Toggle the connection using the F6 Key (Changeable, supports multiple modifier keys)
 
 - **Score Details/ Map Details display** 
 > Displays the current osu! score data in-game without toggling the scoreboard
 
 - **Auto Submission:** 
 > After players hit the last note of the beatmap, *"full combo"* score meeting the requirement would be submitted 
  
 > The score would be submitted to the server while players are on the results screen
 
 - **Auto Blocking:** 
 > Automatically disconnect players from the server after uploading the recent score (API needed)
 
 > Auto blocking also avoid uploading other scores by the players
 
 *Dropping slider ends still count as a "full combo" score
 
 - **Refresh rate slider:** 
 
 > This slider determines the frequency on updating osu! score's statistics
 
 > As for users who use automatic connection/ disconnection, it is recommended to set the refresh rate as 100 (50 is the fastest)
 
 > As for users who have issues on osu! latency, it is recommended to set the refresh rate to more than 250

## API Usage
 
 This application uses [osu! API v1](https://github.com/ppy/osu-api/wiki) to get users' recent uploaded score and automatically disconnect after uploading.
 
 As for the users who are concerned about the API usage, please feel free to not use it :D

## Details on Advanced Firewall Rule

Win + R and type "wf.msc" in "Run" box to open Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security

There should be "osu block" rule enabled which blocks the connection to osu! unless it is disabled (while uploading scores)
